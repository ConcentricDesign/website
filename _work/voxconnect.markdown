  VoxConnect is a cloud-based VoIP phone provider serving Chicagoâ€™s small business community.

  As the company was being founded, we consulted on target audiences, brand positioning, and voice. Then, we used these components to create a visual identity, establish an information architecture, and draft marketing copy. Everything came together in a responsive website design.
