  VoxConnect is a cloud-based VoIP phone provider serving Chicago’s small business community.

  As the company was being founded, we consulted on target audiences, brand positioning, and voice. Then, we used these components to create a visual identity, establish an information architecture, and draft marketing copy. Everything came together in a responsive website design.
