description: Chicago-born pianist and jazz legend Ramsey Lewis was in a need of a
  website refresh and was also looking for a new logo treatment for his name. Referencing
  the playful colors and typography design from early jazz albums, as well as Ramsey’s
  own history, we created a modern take on the past look of jazz that also reflects
  Ramsey’s personality.
