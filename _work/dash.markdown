description: As part of its multi-sector data and information system focus, the Robert
  Wood Johnson Foundation launched Data Across Sectors for Health (DASH). DASH aims
  to identify barriers, opportunities, promising practices and indicators of progress
  for multi-sector collaborations to connect information systems and share data for
  community health improvement. DASH came to us in need of creative direction and
  design for a set of attractive, clear, and consistent publications templates.
