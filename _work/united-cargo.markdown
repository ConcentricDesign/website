description: "United Cargo, part of United Airlines, is an air cargo service that
  provides shipping and business solutions.\n\nIn 2015, the United Cargo marketing
  team wanted to develop unique identity elements to differentiate their business-to-business
  service from United passenger services in order to better serve their customers.
  \n\nWorking with United’s in-house creative team and the United Cargo marketing
  team, we expanded the United visual identity with Cargo-specific brand elements
  including patterns, graphic treatments, and photography styles that are uniquely
  United Cargo."
