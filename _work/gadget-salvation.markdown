lead: Brand strategy, visual identity, and voice for an established electronics marketplace.
description: Gadget Salvation is an electronics marketplace that specializes in giving
  new life to used devices. Our work started as a project to rebrand this established
  company as part of an effort to grow business with a younger generation of customers.
  After analyzing Gadget Salvation’s current digital strategy and researching the
  market landscape, we established their updated positioning as a geeky and youthful,
  environmentally conscious brand. From there, we went on to create a visual identity,
  brand and voice guidelines, custom illustrations, custom emoji (meet Gadji!), website
  writing, a social media campaign, and email templates.
