name: Foy
lead: Visual identity, packaging, digital, and print design for a CBD therapeutics
  start-up.
description: Foy makes wellness-focused therapeutic CBD products. When preparing to
  launch the company, the founders approached Concentric to create a logo. The Foy
  team wanted to stand out in a market saturated with over-designed product packaging
  by using simple, clean design language to communicate their “purpose through wellness”
  message. We created a visual identity system that promotes a wellness mindset across
  all touchpoints. After creating Foy’s identity system, we’ve used it to create all
  product and shipping packaging, an ecommerce website, social media posts, display
  ads, brochures, and business cards.
