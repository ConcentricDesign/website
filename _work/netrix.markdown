  Since 1989, Netrix has helped clients simplify technology sourcing and accelerate technology deployment. They are an expert technology resource for all IT design, integration, maintenance, and management needs.

  With a large and diverse set of businesses, we developed a system of logos to accommodate Netrixâ€™s ever-growing family of brands, products and services.

  Using their annual Netrix Kick-Off (NKO) event to unveil the new identity, we integrated new visual elements into large-scale environmental designs. Creating excitement for the promise of a new year and building a culture around the new identity, NKO was a success on both fronts.
