description: "Since 1849, Chicago Child Care Society (CCCS) has served Chicago’s children
  and families. Located in Hyde Park, CCCS is the oldest continually operating child
  welfare agency in the state of Illinois. \n\nWe helped CCCS evolve its brand to
  match the evolution of the organization’s services in recent years. With such a
  long history of service to the community, it was important to CCCS that they maintain
  some of the equity earned from their previous identity system while modernizing
  the overall look.\n\nWe worked closely with CCCS to implement its new visual identity
  system in a wide variety of contexts including a full website design, email marketing
  templates, printed marketing collateral, and environmental branding."
