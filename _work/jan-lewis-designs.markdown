description: Artist Jan Lewis was looking to reach a new and broader audience by starting
  a line of contemporary lifestyle and fashion products that were a translation of
  her fine art pieces. We developed a vibrant and sophisticated identity with a nod
  to her artistic work as well as a new ecommerce website to propel her business and
  art forward.
